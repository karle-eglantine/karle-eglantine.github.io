## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Inria Lille-Nord Europe in MODAL Team since November 2020. I work under the direction of Cristian Preda and Hemant Tyagi on inverse problems on graphs. I work in particular on inverse problems on dynamic graphs, such as ranking using time-varying data. 

You can find more information about me in my CV.
